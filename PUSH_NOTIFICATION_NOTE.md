# Push Notification Implementation Note

## Current Status

The push notification infrastructure has been implemented with the following features:

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

1. **Frontend PWA Support**
   - Service worker with push event handling
   - Push subscription management
   - iOS-specific install prompts
   - Account Settings UI for notification management

2. **Backend Infrastructure**
   - Push subscription storage in Neo4j
   - Notification scheduler for high priority events
   - Automatic notifications 15 minutes before high priority events
   - Manual trigger endpoint for testing

3. **High Priority Event Notifications**
   - Events marked as "high" priority automatically trigger notifications
   - Notifications sent 15 minutes before event start
   - Distinctive notification styling with action buttons
   - Checked every minute by the scheduler

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Temporary Limitation

Due to a dependency conflict with the `web-push` crate (requires Rust 2024 edition which is not yet stable), the actual push notification sending is currently in simulation mode. The system will:

1. Store push subscriptions correctly
2. Schedule and check for notifications
3. Log notification attempts
4. BUT NOT actually send push notifications to devices

### üìù To Complete Push Implementation

Once the Rust ecosystem stabilizes or the `web-push` crate is updated to work with stable Rust:

1. Uncomment the `web-push = "0.9"` line in `backend/Cargo.toml`
2. Replace the simplified `send_push_notification` function in `backend/src/tools/push.rs` with the full implementation using web-push
3. The full implementation code is available in the git history

### Alternative Solutions

If you need push notifications working immediately, consider:

1. **Use a push service**: Integrate with services like OneSignal, Pusher, or Firebase Cloud Messaging
2. **Use a different language for push**: Create a microservice in Node.js/Python for push handling
3. **Wait for Rust update**: The issue should resolve when Rust 2024 edition becomes stable

### Testing the Current Implementation

Even without actual push sending, you can test the system:

1. Enable notifications in Account Settings
2. Create a high priority event scheduled 15 minutes in the future
3. Check backend logs to see notification scheduling working
4. The system will log "Would send notification" messages

### Environment Variables Required

```env
# Generate these with: npx web-push generate-vapid-keys
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:admin@yourdomain.com
```

## Summary

The entire push notification infrastructure is in place and ready. Only the actual sending of push notifications is temporarily disabled due to a Rust dependency issue. Once resolved, push notifications will work fully with minimal code changes.
